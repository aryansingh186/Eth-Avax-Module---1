## SavingsLocker

## Description

SavingsLocker is a smart contract written in Solidity that allows users to deposit and withdraw funds into/from their savings account. The contract includes three main functions: deposit, withdraw, and setBalance. It ensures that deposits and withdrawals are done safely, preventing negative or invalid transactions.

## Getting Started

* Go to Remix: First, open your web browser and go to the Remix website, which is an online IDE for writing, compiling, and deploying smart contracts. You can access it at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

* Create a New File: Once you're on the Remix website, click on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar to create a new file. Name the file "SavingsLocker.sol" and save it with a .sol extension.
* Open the SavingsLocker.sol file in your Ethereum development environment.
* Compile the contract to check for any compilation errors.

* Deploy the contract to an Ethereum network of your choice (local or testnet) using the development environment's deployment tools.

### Interacting with the Contract
Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it using the following functions:

* Deposit: To deposit funds into your savings account, click on the "deposit" function, enter the amount you want to deposit, and click the "transact" button to execute the deposit function.

* Withdraw: To withdraw funds from your savings account, click on the "withdraw" function, enter the amount you want to withdraw, and click the "transact" button to execute the withdraw function.

* Set Account Balance: You can also set your account balance to a specific value by clicking on the "setBalance" function, entering the desired account balance, and clicking the "transact" button.

## Security Considerations
The contract is designed for educational purposes and may not be suitable for production use without further security audits and enhancements. Always exercise caution when deploying smart contracts to production networks.
